# Wetlands Final Package


Our code is in the "app.R" file name. It has all of the code needed to run our dashboard. 
Our dashboard has 7 different tabs.
The first tab is the overview and it has 3 individual tabs. The first shows the project summary, the second is the water quality variable definitions, and the third tab shows wetland photos. 
The second tab shows water quality comparisons between each site. 
The third tab shows trends in water quality variables monthly, daily, and hourly. 
The fourth tab shows boxplots of each variable by month and by site. 
The fifth tab shows the descriptive model for each variable by month and by site. 
The sixth tab shows weather data through bar plots. It shows each weather variable with the deviation of each variable per month. 
The seventh tab shows the aeration pre and post. It will allow our partner to continue to input data and see future trends by month.
