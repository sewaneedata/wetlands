# Goal Setting and Acceptance Criteria: 
## These are the goals we have for the Wetlands project, as well as, the aspirations we have for the project 


- First format the two datasets so that the dates and values match up 
- Figure out how to run GitHub so that we can collaborate on our code
- Make and format a shiny interactive dashboard where we can just input our data and code and then get graphs and visualizations instead of making the dashboard after the code has been written. 
- We want to choose the variables for which we will be looking for trends in the data and to ensure that we include the variables that our partner is most interested in
- We want to find a value or a variable that determines if water quality is considered ‘good’ or not 
- We want to write the code to find the average measurements of our variables on a monthly basis so that our partner can see a consistent pattern of the data, instead of every single value plotted. We also need to do this because there are multiple measurements per day and data is not collected every single day of the month. 
- The goal is to then add the average data for each variable by month to a shiny dashboard to show the trends of collected measurements by month. There will be a dropdown bar so that you can select which variable you want to show on the graph and it will be by month. This is a mandatory goal. 
- An aspirational goal is to show the same data as the first tab but add a second dropdown bar that shows you things that may have affected the collected data, like temperature and wind speed. 
- The third aspirational goal is to make a third tab in the dashboard that shows the same data as the first two plots but graphed against hours per day and years. 
- We also want to make sure the dashboard is formatted so that Dr. McGrath can continue to upload data from the wetlands and show trends in the data, so we need to make it organized and show her how she will input her data. 
- We need to write a script so that our partner can easily input her data without having to write the code for it
- We need to make a predictive model for each variable in the datasets that our partner wants to see included so that she can see how it will trend in the future. This will not go out to the dashboard, but will instead be shared directly with our partner and will show predicted measurements per month for the next few years that she will be collecting data.  



# Pre-Mortem: 
## These are the failures we could potentially see happening in our project, as well as the solutions to these problems. 

- Formatting the dashboard so that we show everything we need to show; meaning that we get to our aspirational goals. This could fail because our group is not very skilled in Shiny so the design and creation of the interactive parts of the dashboard could fail. A solution is to organize and give each person a specific thing to complete for the dashboard, as well as, to get another session in Shiny dashboard
- Another failure we hypothesize is teaching our partner how to understand the code so that if needed she can make changes to reflect changes in the data. As long as the google sheet is updated and formatted correctly there should be no issue in her running the code after we have finished the project. 
- Github could be another failure, like if someone does not upload their code correctly we could lose access to that data, but as long as we push our code every day this should not be an issue.
